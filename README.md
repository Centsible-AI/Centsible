# Centsible

**Centsible** is a cutting-edge financial management app designed to empower you to take control of your money. With deeply personalized budgeting, dynamic stock recommendations, an intuitive tax filer, and our AI-powered Budget Buddy chatbot, Centsible makes managing your finances simple, accessible, and tailored to your unique needs—all for just $8.99 per month.

## Introduction

Managing your finances is an essential part of life, yet far too many Americans struggle with it. Centsible steps in to simplify your financial journey with unparalleled customization options and user-friendly tools. Whether you need a straightforward budget planner or intelligent stock recommendations, our app is here to help you save smarter, spend better, and build wealth over time.

## Problem / Solution

Despite widespread use of financial apps, many users still grapple with financial illiteracy—in a study by the TIAA Institute, American adults answered only 48% of financial literacy questions correctly, with younger generations scoring even lower. With over 60% of Americans living paycheck to paycheck, there’s a clear need for a solution that is both flexible and intuitive.

Centsible tackles these challenges head on:
- **Simplicity & Flexibility:** Unlike many overcomplicated apps, Centsible offers a fully customizable experience that adapts to your financial circumstances.
- **Actionable Insights:** Our dynamic budget planner leverages an open-source **PyTorch model integrated with Streamlit** to analyze your spending and income, then generate a realistic, sustainable budget.
- **Ongoing Support:** With weekly notifications, smart tax filing, and personalized stock recommendations, Centsible keeps you informed and proactive about your financial health.

## Target Market

Centsible is designed with both young professionals and individuals facing financial hardships in mind. Millennials and Gen Z, in particular, prefer digital banking solutions; with 97% of Millennials already using such services, they are primed for an app that combines cutting-edge AI with practical budgeting advice. Additionally, our goal is to help those in challenging financial situations make smarter, data-driven financial decisions.
